## Installation

- Use Chrome (Firefox not supported yet due to manifest v3)
- Open the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
- Install the plugin

## Usage

- Make sure the plugin is installed (seeing the WH icon on the top right. If there is no icon, click on the icon looking like a puzzle and there click the "Pin" icon for this plugin)
- Make sure you are registered on [Cannergrow](https://cannergrow.com/r/XJ7QY3)
- Open your dashboard in [Cannergrow](https://cannergrow.com/r/XJ7QY3)
- Click on the plugin icon and then on "Synchronize"
- Wait for the sync to finish. Then you can download the JSON
- Optional: Make an account on [werteherren.de](https://werteherren.de) - It is 100% free and you can use the net return calculator even without being in the team

## Development

- Warning: As the time i am writing this, Firefox does not support the manifest v3 so this extension does not work.
